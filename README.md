####  Additional Libraries Used For This Template ####

The additional libraries used for this project include the ``moment`` library which can be installed using ``npm install moment``. This library was used for extarcting current date and time for timestamping articles and comments on my Blogging tool. 



#### Starting this Template ####

In order to start this template, the user first needs to download node modules using ``npm install``. This is followed by ``npm install moment``. 
The user then needs to run the database using ``npm run build-db`` and then finally run the program using ``npm run start``. 





#### Preparing for submission ####

Make a copy of your project folder.
In your copy, delete the following files and folders:
* node_modules
* .git (the hidden folder with your git repository)
* database.db (your database)

Make sure that your ``package.json`` file includes all of the dependencies for your project. NB. you need to use the ```--save``` tag each time you use npm to install a dependency

Edit this README.md to explain any specific instructions for setting up or using your application that you want to bring to our attention:

* remove the existing contents that we have provided
* include any settings that should be adjusted in configuration files
* include a list of the additional libraries you are using -- ```moment library```
* anything else we need to know in order to successfully run your app


NB. we will ONLY run ```npm install```, ```npm run build-db```, and ```npm run start``` . We will NOT install additional packages to run your code and will NOT run additional build scripts. Be careful with any additional node dependencies that you use.
